# castironpan
Website for a prototype mini-paint art painting application using only HTML/CSS/Javascript. Student project for CodeFellows.
Project name: Castiron Pan Mini Paint App
Main Contributor: Maddie Lewis

This is a responsive website, with one CSS animation, with a pixel painting application constructed in Javascript. The provided palettes have been constructed to accomodate for differing needs using palette generators and research. If testing application, please send comments about accessibility & efforts will be made to try to improve the app's UI. 

Problem: Create a website with optimized HTML/CSS with an interactive Javascript element. This website has a responsive UI. The pixel application provides different palettes and a color picker for both the brush tools and the background. App will include presents for background colors, a grid that can turn on and off to help with pixel art, premade color palettes, and the option to construct a color palette. The user will be able to save the images they create. It should save the current image upon a refresh of the page.
